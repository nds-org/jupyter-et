    "\n",
    "On Mac, please first \n",
    "- Install [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) from the Apple [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835). In *addition* agree to Xcode license and install the Xcode Command Line Tools in Terminal \n",

    "sudo xcodebuild -license\n",

    "- when using HomeBrew\n",
    "  - install HomeBrew for your version of the Mac operating system, if you have not already installed it (https://brew.sh/). \n",
    "  - make sure to add /opt/homebrew/bin to your PATH as instructed by the installation script. You may need to restart your terminal. \n",
    "  - Next, please install the following packages, using the commands:\n",
