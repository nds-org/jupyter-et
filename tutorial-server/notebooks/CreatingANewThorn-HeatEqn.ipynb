    "# Creating a New Thorn -- HeatEqn\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will walk through the process of creating a new thorn from scratch. As a new user, you may be content at first to run simulations that have already been assembled by someone else (such as the gallery examples). Beyond that you may want to assemble your own simulation using existing thorns. However at some point you may have an application that involves a step, or calculation, or algorithm, that no existing thorn performs. At that point, you need to write your own thorn to carry out that subroutine. The case study we will consider here is to create a thorn to evolve the standard heat equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a brief overview of what a thorn needs to include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a Cactus thorn must have a name.\n",
    "* a Cactus thorn must live in an arrangement.\n",
    "* a Cactus thorn must have four ccl (Cactus Configuration Language) files:\n",
    "    * `interface.ccl`\n",
    "    * `schedule.ccl`\n",
    "    * `param.ccl`\n",
    "    * `configuration.ccl`\n",
    "* a Cactus thorn must have a `src` directory\n",
    "* a Cactus thorn must have a `make.code.defn` file in that source directory\n",
    "\n",
    "The above thorn files and directories should reside in `Cactus/arrangements/ArrangementName/ThornName/`."

    "This notebook grew out of a series of notebook-based tutorials delivered by Steve Brandt at the 2017 Einstein Toolkit school and workshop at NCSA. Those tutorials were based on his \"Funwave\" example--a simulation that models coastal waves. The current notebook is an attempt at a condensed version of the \"create a new thorn\" tutorial for new user's. To that end, the Funwave example has been replaced by a simpler case study--the standard heat equation--in order to fit everything into a single notebook. The aim has been to provide a more transparent example of how to create a new thorn from scratch. For new users, this is a daunting task, which the author of this notebook fully recognizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A big thanks goes to Steve Brandt for his outstanding series of Jupyter notebooks on the in's and out's of the Einstein Toolkit. His tutorials go far beyond this one, both in depth and breadth. They cover many common gotcha issues that this notebook glosses over. I would encourage any new user to work through them; it is well worth the effort to get them to work on your machine. They can be found in the Google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4gNfWainf-5R3BldGJuRlo4dHc) and video of the 2017 workshop sessions can be found on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqgEaUjl23I), starting at the 4:08:37 mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks also goes to Yosef Zlochower, whose heat equation example has been used in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "My role has basically been to merge the pedagogical clarity and thoroughness of Steve's tutorials (including his fully commented ccl file templates) with the simplicity of Yosef's example. I am fully responsible for any bugs or confusions that remain in the final result. --Eric J West\n",
